UPLOAD.COM does the opposite of DOWNLOAD.COM

You will need to package a file before DOWNLOAD.COM can download it.  Grant Searle has a utility to do this, or you can use the online converter here http://rc2014.co.uk/filepackage/

You can install UPLOAD.COM on to your RC2014 by copying & pasting the UPLOAD.PKG file directly in to your terminal.  From there, any file can be uploaded back to your terminal by typing A:UPLOAD MYFILE.TXT where MYFILE.TXT is any file you wish to upload.

https://rc2014.co.uk/fileunpackage/ can be used to unpackage the file.

More details on the use of UPLOAD.COM can be found here https://blog.peacockmedia.software/2022/01/uploadcom-for-z80-cpm-usage.html
